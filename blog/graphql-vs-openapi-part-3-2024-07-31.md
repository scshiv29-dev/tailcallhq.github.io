  Create a schema configuration file that specifies your upstream REST API and defines your GraphQL types and queries.

  ```graphql
  schema
    @upstream(
      baseURL: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
    ) {
    query: Query
  }

  type Query {
    user(id: Int!): User @http(path: "/users/{{.args.id}}")
  }

  type User {
    id: Int!
    name: String!
    username: String!
    email: String!
    posts: [Post] @http(path: "/users/{{.value.id}}/posts")
  }

  type Post {
    id: Int!
    title: String!
    body: String!
  }
  ```

- **Attach Resolvers Using Directives:**

  Tailcall uses directives to attach resolvers to your schema fields. The `@http` directive specifies how to fetch data from REST endpoints.

  ```graphql
  type Query {
    user(id: Int!): User @http(path: "/users/{{.args.id}}")
  }

  type User {
    id: Int!
    name: String!
    username: String!
    email: String!
    posts: [Post] @http(path: "/users/{{.value.id}}/posts")
  }
  ```

- **Start the GraphQL Server:**

Use Tailcall's CLI to start your GraphQL server based on the configuration.

```sh
tailcall start path/to/your-graphql-configuration
```

3. **Implement Resolvers:**

   - Develop resolvers to handle the queries and mutations defined in your GraphQL schema. Resolvers act as the data fetchers that connect your GraphQL queries to your underlying data sources, including your existing RESTful services.

   **Example:**

   ```javascript
   const resolvers = {
     Query: {
       user: async (_, {id}) => {
         return await fetch(
           `https://example.com/api/users/${id}`,
         ).then((res) => res.json())
       },
       allUsers: async () => {
         return await fetch(
           "https://example.com/api/users",
         ).then((res) => res.json())
       },
     },
     Mutation: {
       createUser: async (_, {name, email}) => {
         return await fetch(
           "https://example.com/api/users",
           {
             method: "POST",
             headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
             body: JSON.stringify({name, email}),
           },
         ).then((res) => res.json())
       },
     },
   }
   ```

   **Best Practice:**Optimizing resolvers is crucial for maintaining high performance in your GraphQL API. Efficient resolver implementation involves minimizing the number of database queries and addressing the N+1 query problem through batching and caching requests.

4. **Set Up a Gateway:**

   - Set up a GraphQL gateway to act as an intermediary layer that can unify multiple data sources, including RESTful services, under a single GraphQL API. While this doesn't allow for gradual migration of individual endpoints, it enables a unified approach where both GraphQL and RESTful services can coexist. This setup allows you to maintain your existing RESTful services while introducing GraphQL capabilities, facilitating a smoother transition.

   **Example:** Apollo Gateway is a popular tool that helps in setting up a GraphQL gateway. It allows you to federate multiple GraphQL services into a single unified API.

   **Best Practice:** Implement a unified GraphQL API using a gateway that integrates various existing services, including RESTful APIs. This way, you can leverage the strengths of both GraphQL and REST, maintaining operational continuity while progressively adopting GraphQL.

By leveraging these tools and methodologies, developers can ensure a smooth and efficient migration from REST to GraphQL while maintaining operational continuity and security.

5. **Test and Optimize:**

   - Thoroughly test your new GraphQL API to ensure it meets performance and security requirements. Use tools like GraphQL Playground for testing queries and mutations. Tailcall’s features can assist in monitoring performance and managing schema changes effectively.

   **Best Practice:** Perform load testing and security audits to identify potential bottlenecks and vulnerabilities. Optimize your resolvers and queries based on the test results to enhance performance.
